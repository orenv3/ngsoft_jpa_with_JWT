Write a Spring Boot application that exposes a RESTful API for managing a list of tasks and users.
The API should allow clients to perform the following actions:

   * Login and retrieve an oauth2 bearer token, to be used for the below actions!
    * Retrieve the list of tasks
    * Add a new task to the list
    * Update the details of a task
    * Mark a task as completed
    * Remove a task from the list
    * Retrieve the list of users
    * Add a new user to the list
    * Update the details of a user
    * Remove a user from the list
    * Add comment to task

Tables:
 task:
     ID (generated automatically)
     Title
     Description
     Status (pending/completed/archived)
     Assignee (user to whom the task is assigned)

 Comment:
    ID (generated automatically)
    UserId (foreign key)
    TaskId (foreign key)
    TimeStamp (Date)
    Comment (Text)

 user:
     ID (generated automatically)
     Name
     Email
     IsAdmin (true,false)
     Active (true,false)
     Password (hashed)

 Description:
    1. Make sure that user can only fetch and see his tasks.
    2. When he sees the task he may see ALL Comments (even if he did not make them).
    3. User can:
        a. view his tasks and their comments,
        b. comment on his tasks,
        c. mark as completed.
    4. Admin can:
        a. create users,
        b. activate/deactivate user,
        c. create tasks,
        d. assign/re-assign tasks,
        e. comment on tasks and
        f. mark completed tasks as archived
    5. An archived task is not visible to the user.
    6. Use an in-memory database (such as H2) to store the tasks and users.
    7. Implement password hashing and authentication/authorization for the user API using Spring Security
